# RSVP System
An Open Source Drupal project focused on building advance reservation systems.

This project provides documentation and example data to help explain the build process.

Functionalities:

- **RSVP Department**: A taxonomy used to categorize locations. This taxonomy allows for sorting and filtering of locations by department.

- **RSVP Location**: A content type designed for managing detailed information about reservable locations. This includes complex functionalities such as bookings, galleries, and additional location-specific data that facilitates efficient reservation management.

- **RSVP Request**: A content type used for submitting reservation details. This dynamic entity includes fields for date, time, status (Pending, Approved, Declined, Canceled), user details, and links to specific RSVP Locations.

- **RSVP Log**: A content type for logging all activities related to reservation requests. This includes recording outcomes like approvals, declines, and cancellations, serving as a historical record to maintain data integrity and provide insights into reservation trends and outcomes.

## Required Modules
- **Content Access**: Secures locations by managing access permissions, ensuring that reservation data is protected and accessible only to authorized users. [Learn more](https://www.drupal.org/project/content_access).
